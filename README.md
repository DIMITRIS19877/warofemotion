# Virtual Background and Sound Effects Application

This Python application creates an interactive experience by using the computer's camera to display the user with a virtual background and adding sound effects when the spacebar is pressed.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you will need:

- Python 3.11.2: Main programming language.
- OpenCV (cv2) 4.5.5: Used for video capture and processing.
- Pygame 2.5.2: Employed for audio playback and user interaction.
- NumPy 1.24.2: Utilized for mathematical operations and video frame processing.

Additionally, a camera connected to your computer and an `audio.mp3` sound file along with a `video.mp4` video file in the same directory as the script are required.

## Installation

First, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pygame numpy
